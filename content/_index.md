### üòä Who I Am üòä 

My name is Trevor Bushnell! I'm a tenor from Spokane, WA and a huge choir nerd! I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics with a focus in Data Science. During that process, I fell in love with singing and choirs and met some fantastic singers and inspiring future teachers. Being in such a supportive music community convinced me to pursue a career in music education. 

### :musical_score: My Musical Interests :musical_score:

1. Finding ways to locate engaging/challenging repertoire and cultivate a positive learning environment for treble (SSAA) choirs to shift the perspective of treble groups as "stepping stone" ensembles
1. Computational musicology - how computer programming can be used to aid in the discovery of musical scores and composers
1. AI choir music - analyzing the quality of AI generated choir music as well as how easy it is for humans to sing

### :musical_note: My Favorite Choral ______:musical_note:

* **Work:** Handel's *Messiah*, Bach's *St. Matthew's Passion*, Eric Whitacre's *The Sacred Veil*, and Gregorio Allegri's "Miserere Mei"
* **Choral Composer:** William Byrd, Eric Whitacre, Jocelyn Hagen
* **Choral Group:** VOCES8, The King's Singers, Chanticleer
* **Musical:** Come From Away (overall), The Lion King (for the impressive choral-like music), and Newsies (because yes)

### üïí What I'm Currently Doing üïí

I'm a post-bacc student pursuing a BA in Music at Gonzaga University and serving as the student conductor for Gonzaga Choirs. My current aspirations are to teach choir at the high school level. I'm learning everything I can about being an effective educator - both general secondary education skills and music/conducting practices. 

Additionally, I sing professionally in the greater Spokane area through singing at various churches and being an active member of the Spokane Symphony Chorale. I'm also an actively learning choral composer.

In my spare time, I write blog articles (published here!) about my experience shifting careers and what I'm learning about in music. The goal of the blog is to inspire other people to either pursue music, find comfort and peace when it comes to transitioning your career, or both!

I also still maintain my work in data science and software development, which you can check out on my [tech portfolio](https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/tech-portfolio).
