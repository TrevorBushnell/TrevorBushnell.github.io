### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of data science and statistics. I use Python, R, and Julia to do my data science and computational mathematics tasks. 


#### Interests
I am a huge numbers geek and love to analyze and interpret data. While this is my main career focus, I also occasionally develop on projects for the speedrunning community, including simple bingo generators and trackers for speedruns. Additionally, I'm passionate about SSI (self-sovereign identity), a new technology that is allowing us to verify our identities on the internet - a feat that we have yet to accomplish in the digital age.

#### Projects List

* **Honors Thesis: Analyzing the Singability of Choral AI** (in-progress)
* **Gonzaga Choirs Digital Library Web App** (currently getting bux fixes)
* **Splatoon 3 Personal Battle Data Dashboard** (under a dev rehaul)
* **STEM-Notes** (In Continuous Development as I add new notes for my classes)
* **Numerical Methods in Julia** (in progress)
* **Data Science Resources** (in progress)
* **NSMBU/NSMB2 Bingo Board Generators** (completed)
* **School Data Science Projects** (completed)
* **Trinsic Login Demo** (in-progress)
