## Hi There!

My name is Trevor Bushnell! I'm a tenor from Spokane, WA and a huge choir nerd! I got my undergraduate degree in Statistics with a focus in Data Science. During that process, I fell in love with singing and choirs and met some fantastic singers and inspiring future teachers. Being in such a supportive music community convinced me to pursue a career in music education. 

Now, I'm pursuing my masters degree in Secondary Education with a focus on Choral Music at Gonzaga University. My current aspirations are to teach choir at the high school level. In the meantime, I'm learning everything I can about being an effective educator - both general secondary education skills and music/conducting practices. 

I'm also an active choir member across Spokane. I'm an active member of many classical choirs at Gonzaga University. Additionally, I sing professionally in the greater Spokane area through singing at various churches and being an active member of the Spokane Symphony. I'm also an actively learning choral composer, with my works being premiered by choirs in Spokane.

In my spare time, I write blog articles (published here!) about my experience shifting careers and what I'm learning about in music. The goal of the blog is to inspire other people to either pursue music, find comfort and peace when it comes to transitioning your career, or both!
