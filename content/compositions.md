## Be Still My Soul (SSAA)

My first introduction to choral music was through this beautiful melody written by Jean Sibelius. As someone who has struggled with Asperger's syndrome his entire life, I've had many challenging situations in my life that go unnoticed by most people. Since I've worked hard to overcome my mental struggles, many people write me off when I make a social mistake and don't understand that many times I genuinely have no idea what I've done is wrong or hurtful. This constant struggle when I make mistakes wears on me, even after I've done the work to rectify the situation. It's hard and challenging and I often feel overwhelmed and alone.

Whenever I get overwhelmed, Be Still My Soul is the hymn I constantly return to in order to calm myself down. As such, I wanted to write my own arrangement of the song that I could have for my own solace. The music features the constant internal struggles that I feel through tight, boxed-in harmonies and the constant play between the F major and D minor chords that make up a majority of the harmonies of the second verse.
