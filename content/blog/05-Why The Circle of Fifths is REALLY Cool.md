I've got plenty of friends who love the Circle of Fifths. I've mentioned the friend who puts it all over whiteboards across campus on this blog before, but there's plenty more people who praise it until the end of the world. Also those same people also hate me for it because of one question I asked them over the summer when I was bored:

> *Why is the Circle of Fifths a circle?*

Before going on, I should probably give a brief description of what this concept is. The **Circle of Fifths** is a diagram that puts all 12 pitches in a circle such that going clockwise on the circle means going upwards the interval of a fifth (or going backwards on the circle means going down a fourth). It looks like this:

This is something that you learn pretty quickly into your first music theory class because it gives you a way to easily calculate fifths. When I ask people why its in the shape of a circle, this is the main reason every die-hard music theory person references. 

However, my math background has massive gripes with this. A circle is not the only way to visualize this pattern. Alternatively, you could display this information on a number line, likeso:

![INCLUDE AN IMAGE OF THE LINE OF FIFTHS]()

This "Line of Fifths" in some ways makes more sense in terms of the pattern because there are an infinite number of pitches extending both high and low. When I bring up this line idea, I was given mixed responses. Some people simply gave up and went "You right, I just like looking at circles, makes sense for me and my brain." Others died on a hill trying to justify why the circle made the most sense, but couldn't formalize a reason other than "to show the repeating pattern of fifths." Either way, this made me realize something critical - we learn WHAT is the circle of fifths and how to use it, but we are not told WHY it's a circle. I feel knowing the why behind the choice of a circle is just as important  as knowing the layout of the circle. Lately, I've done some of my own research and discoveries, and I've realized that the choice behind using a circle is actually *very* intentional and has re-ignited my love for why the Circle of Fifths is so absolutely fantastic. 

In this article, I'll give you **three justifications for why the Circle of Fifths is indeed a circle.** I'll be honest, if you aren't a music theory nerd then you will definitely not like this article (sorry). For those that are grossly in love with the circle of fifths, read on - hopefully you'll learn something new by the end of this blog :smile:.
