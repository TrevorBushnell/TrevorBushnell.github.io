# Why Choral Singers Should Learn Music Theory

When I was a part of the choir program at Gonzaga during my undergraduate tenure, most students were very foreign to music theory. Some students were music minors and thus took one year of theory their freshman year, but didn't get super exicted about it (or even hated the class). Even the music majors who are in the choir aren't actively using music theory concepts while they are rehearsing, even if they are more comfortable with the subject.
