## Honorable Mentions

There were so manys songs that I wish I could include on this list, but in an effort to not make this post too long some cuts had to be made. Nevertheless, here are a few songs that were really close to making the list:

* **Beati Quorum Via, Gaudete in Domino, My Spirit Sang All Day:** Surprisingly, no songs from my tour from Italy with the Chamber Choir made it onto this list. These 3 songs were my favorites from the ones they took on tour. These songs always sounded the best in the various churches and basilicas we sang in. Gauduete in Domino was my favorite because we sang the piece in the basicila where the composer was buried!
* **Ubi Caritas (Durufle), I Wonder as I Wander (Rutter):** I didn't weant this list to completely turn into Christmas music so I refrained from adding these. However, these songs are near and dear to my heart and they were an absolute blast to perform on our Candlelight Christmas concert.
* **Will the Circle Be Unbroken:** This traditional Appilachian song was an absolute BANGER to sing. I adore this piece, and having a director who spent a decent part of her career in that culture shape the song was really inspiring. It did not make the final list because many people failed to get the song into their bodies and buy into the song, so it lost a bit of its value and impact for me because of that.

Alright, here are the top 3!

There you have it, all of my favorite pieces I sang while I was in the choirs at Gonzaga University. These songs will leave lasting memories for me for the rest of my life, and I can't wait to create even more memories during my graduate studies here at Gonzaga!
