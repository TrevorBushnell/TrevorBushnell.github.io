It's that time of year again - the beginning of a new school year! I've been busy doing various work this past week to prepare for the upcoming semester, and I'm excited to get to work with everyone again for another year of beautiful (and busy!) musicmaking. 

Going into this new year, I know that many of you are excited to be the new leaders of the choir, and I can't wait to cheer you on from the sidelines and watch you grow and develop in your leadership. To encourage some of the up and coming musical leaders of the year, I thought that I would throw together some of the things that I've have learned about being a good musical leader - specifically a section leader. I've served as section leader at Gonzaga before, and I serve a section leader position in choirs around Spokane. I've definitely had both experiences that I am proud of and experiences that I wish I could turn the clock back and fix. If you are interested in being a section leader this upcoming year or you want to develop some musical leadership skills (because you don't need a title to practice being a leader!), here are some tips that I have on leading good sectional rehearsals.

## 1. Internalize Your Music

I'm very intentional about the wording of this point. If you are going to be a musical leader, simply "knowing your music" is not an option. You are an extension of the director - when sectionals are happening you are in charge of leading and potentially teaching music if needed. As such, you need to be so familiar with your part that you can teach it to your fellow singers. It's one thing to sing every note correctly - it's another to teach it to another person.
