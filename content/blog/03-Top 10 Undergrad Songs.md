In the recent months since my career decision, I've been spending lots of time reflecting on the positive experiences I've had through my first bachelor's degree at Gonzaga. It's been a great way to calm myself down about the change to come and remind myself that these last four years have not been a waste. In my time reflecting I've been reminded of the many memories and fantastic songs I've had the honor to sing. There's been some really cool songs that I have had the opportunity to sing as well as songs that have expanded my ears and opinions on what good choral music can sound like. I figured this could turn into a really cool blog post, so here are my **top 10 favorite choral songs** I've sung in college, along with the memories, stories, and heartfelt moments I've had with this music.

## #10: Earth Song (Frank Tichelli)

* Semester performed: Spring 2022
* Ensemble: Concordanza
* Check out our recording of the piece!

I sang this group with one of the first ensembles I founded. In the midst of a global pandemic and a transition of directors, choir felt in a weird place. A few of us simply wanted a place to be able to sing about the messages and emotions that we wanted to sing about, on our own time and free from the distractions and requirements of the rest of the world. Earth Song was the perfect repertoire choice for us to be able to accomplish those goals. 

Earth Song was written in response to the war in Iraq. The message says that despite the hardships and troubles of our world, music can always be a place of refuge. That was true for us as we were navigating what our choral program would look like, and it was true for the refugees in Ukraine as that crisis had just started. 

Fun fact: we were invited to sing at a banquet for people who donate large sums of money to Gonzaga. Thayne was in one of the tables near the front, and one of my fellow group members claims that he was in tears after we finished this song. But that was awhile ago, maybe I'm misremembering things :wink:.

*What I learned:* Make music for yourself. Collegiate music making is filled with so many competitions, concerts, retreats, and more professional gigs that many times it feels like a job. Remind yourself why you are making music and share in this beautiful artform with your friends.

## #9: If Ye Love Me (Thomas Tallis)

* Semester performed: Fall 2023 (Retreat)
* Ensemble: Concert Choir
* Check out our recording of the piece!

It's not a Trevor Top 10 Choir song list if there isn't any Renaissance music on there. If Ye Love Me by Thomas Tallis was one of the first choir songs that got me addicted to the artform in the first place. I first heard this piece covered by the Kings Singers right at lockdown and I was hooked. If you go back far enough on my Instagram, you can see me singing all four parts with myself... quite poorly though because I was young and did not know what I did not know :sweat_smile:.

Having listened to this song a lot of times, I have a very specific idea in my head about how I thought this song was supposed to go. As such, when we got ready to perform this song at the mass service for the monastery that hosts our choir retreat at the beginning of each year, I was shocked at how much Dr. Stohlmann did things... well not as I expected. The two major differences from what I had listened to were the tempo being much faster than I'm used to - every recording I listened to took it very legato. Additionally, those who listen to the Brits sing this song know that the word "sp'rit" is a hot word to pronounce, and we did not pronounce it in the English way. Having to sing through these changes really messed with my muscle memory and I had to work hard to incorporate those changes into my singing, and I grumbled after every rehearsal when we worked on this. 

Fast forward to the mass performance and I realized that the changes actually worked quite well (shocker!). Considering the space that we were in, the audience that we were singing for, and where our group was at after only 2 weeks of rehearsals, the changes made were actually quite fitting and refreshing. It was a modern take on a well-respected part of the sacred repertoire while still upholding what made the song so special. 

*What I learned:* Find new spins and ways of thinking to rejuvenate older repertoire in order to captivate the modern audience. You'd be surprised what you can get away with that still keeps everyone engaged.

## #8: O Come Emmanuel (Robert Shaw)

* Semester performed: every Candlelight Christmas Concert!
* Ensemble: ALL choirs!
* Here's Robert Shaw's choir singing the piece

O Come Emmanuel is a typical Christmas song that many people for sure know. This arrangement by Robert Shaw is unique due to the reverence communicated in the feel of the music by using thick chords and making use of the chant-part of the original melody. Since Dr. Stohlmann's arrival to Gonzaga, this is how our Candlelight Christmas Concert opens every year. 

The effect that this entrance has an audience is insane. The piece starts with all the tenors and basses singing the melody a capella with the low basses droning an E2 (we added that part for fun). Then, the sopranos come in taking the second verse while the tenors and basses sing the first verse in a tempo that's half the speed of the line of the sopranos and altos. It finally ends with everyone singing at the end of verse 2. Oh and I forgot to mention... we process in with candles from the back of the auditorium. This means that the audience hears the tenors and basses from behind them, then gradually get louder due to us walking through the aisles. The sopranos and altos follow them shortly after at the start of their verse. It's such an epic opener to a concert that is tradition not only for the Gonzaga community but also the greater Spokane community. The processional gives me the energy I need to ride the concert to the very end and have the intensity and focus required of this concert. 

*What I learned:* ... I'm not sure, it was just cool okay? Can I have my moment with how this piece made me feel the two times I sang it?

## #7: House of the Rising Sun (Joshua Shank)

* Semester performed: Spring 2023
* Ensemble: Glee Club
* Here's a recording of the piece

This is not the piece you think it is. House of the Rising Sun was written by former Glee Club conductor Joshua Shank. He wrote this song because he wanted to find a way to memorialize the victims that died in the UpStairs Lounge in 1973 - an arson in a gay bar that killed 32 members as an attack against the LGBTQIA+ community. 

Everyone in Glee Club was excited because we assumed that we were singing the classic that was made famous by The Animals. However, after Stohlmann made us read the program note left by Dr. Shank in the cover of our music, we realized it was anything but that. The music is actually quite intense and powerful - it makes sense as to why it was written for TTBB voicing because the sheer power needed to express the music really can't come from any other arrangement of voices. Stohlmann also made us watch [a documentary about the UpStairs Lounge fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPWrK9Pu7Gk), and the story sickening. Many of the images we had to see were incredibly disturbing, and upon returning to class we all realized that the lyrics perfectly depicted many of the gruesome images that we saw in the documentary. 

This was by far the hardest song I've ever had to sing. Not because of the notes, not because of the dynamics, not because of some other musical reason, but because every time I sang those words I could not get those images out of my head. It's hard to sing a song that communicates so much pain and anguish, and it didn't help that we sang it in 2023 - the 50th anniversary of the incident. 

Why do I love this song so much then? Because I've never seen a group of singers rally behind a song as much as I saw our Glee Club lean into this story. We had many conversations in class about how our personal feelings towards the song, how to communicate the meaning to the audience, and more importantly how to do it the *right* way without simply doing it as any other standard act of allyship. We also had a conversation with Joshua Shank himself to get into his mind when he wrote the piece. The final result at our spring concert was incredibly powerful and inspiring for our audience, and it was received very well.

*What I learned:* It's possible to have productive conversations about music that can translate into performance. I had done this kind of thing before in the past with Concert Choir, but every time it felt forced and not everyone was buying into it. This was the first time where I saw every SINGLE singer in the room buy into a song and how to authentically perform it. 

## #6: Twa Tanbou (Sydney Guillame)

* Semester performed: Fall 2022 (Tour)
* Ensemble: Concert Choir
* Here's us singing this on tour!

This song is a story of three drums. Each drum thinks it's the favorite drum, but by the end they all realize it's important to work together as a team. You can tell from the writing which part is which drum, who tries to take center stage, and the moment when everyone realizes it's more fun to work together in order to make beautiful art. 

What's funny is when trying to learn this song, that's *exactly* how it played out in our choir. Everyone was so focused on nailing their own individual part that it was near impossible to put everything together into one coherent story. It got to the point where everyone in the choir was so frustrated with the song there was considerations about removing it from our first concert. 

Then, all of a sudden, as if like MAGIC... the piece just fell into place. Everyone got it and realized how to work together in order to make art. Once we got it, we never wanted to stop singing it. Getting to show off this piece over and over again for various high school students in the Vancouver/Portland area was an absolute blast.

*What I learned:* Trust and also ENJOY the process. We very easily get caught up in how the performance goes, but the work leading up to a performance is just as valuable. Live music is never perfect, and maybe your best take happens in a rehearsal instead of a concert. Keep your eyes, ears, and heart open at every part of the music making process so you can enjoy those special moments right when they happen.

## #5: O Magnum Mysterium (Morten Lauridsen)

* Semester performed: Candlelight Christmas 2022

## Honorable Mentions

There were so manys songs that I wish I could include on this list, but in an effort to not make this post too long some cuts had to be made. Nevertheless, here are a few songs that were really close to making the list:

* **The Music of Stillness:** Sung with Chamber Choir in Spring 2022, this song is just absolutely gorgeous. Many of you know I have mixed feelings about my preferences of Elaine Hagenberg's works, but this one is a Trevor-certified banger. This is a song that I am keeping in my repertoire for when I have my own choir, as I would love to conduct this piece.
* **Beati Quorum Via, Gaudete in Domino, My Spirit Sang All Day:** Surprisingly, no songs from my tour from Italy with the Chamber Choir made it onto this list. These 3 songs were my favorites from the ones we took on tour, and they always sounded the best in the various churches and basilicas we sang in. Gauduete in Domino was my favorite because we sang the piece in the basilica where the composer was buried!
* **Ubi Caritas (Durufle), I Wonder as I Wander (Rutter):** I didn't want this list to completely turn into Christmas music so I refrained from adding these. However, these songs are near and dear to my heart and they were an absolute blast to perform on our Candlelight Christmas concerts.
* **Will the Circle Be Unbroken:** This traditional Appilachian song was an absolute BANGER to sing. I adore this piece, and having a director who spent a decent part of her career in that culture shape the song was really inspiring. It did not make the final list because many people failed to get the song into their bodies and buy into the song, so it lost a bit of its value and impact for me because of that.

Alright, here are the top 3!

CONTENT TO GO HERE

There you have it, all of my favorite pieces I sang while I was in the choirs at Gonzaga University. These songs will leave lasting memories for me for the rest of my life, and I can't wait to create even more memories during my last (???) year here at Gonzaga. Choral music is such a beautiful artform to participate in, both professionally and recreationally. I hope that if you are participating in a choir during your educational experience, you are taking advantage of every moment and keeping your mind alert to learning experiences that will benefit you beyond the classroom. When doing this, you too can look back on your choral experience in undergrad and recall all the memories that made your singing career that much more special :smile:.
