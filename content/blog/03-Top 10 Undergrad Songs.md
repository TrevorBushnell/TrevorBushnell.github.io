In the recent months since my career decision, I've been spending lots of time reflecting on the positive experiences I've had through my first bachelor's degree at Gonzaga. It's been a great way to calm myself down about the change to come and remind myself that these last four years have not been a waste. In my time reflecting I've been reminded of the many memories and fantastic songs I've had the honor to sing. There's been some really cool songs that I have had the opportunity to sing as well as songs that have expanded my ears and opinions on what good choral music can sound like. I figured this could turn into a really cool blog post, so here are my **top 10 favorite choral songs** I've sung in college, along with the memories, stories, and heartfelt moments I've had with this music.

## #10: Earth Song (Frank Tichelli)

* Semester performed: Spring 2022
* Ensemble: Concordanza
* Check out our recording of the piece!

I sang this group with one of the first ensembles I founded. In the midst of a global pandemic and a transition of directors, choir felt in a weird place. A few of us simply wanted a place to be able to sing about the messages and emotions that we wanted to sing about, on our own time and free from the distractions and requirements of the rest of the world. Earth Song was the perfect repertoire choice for us to be able to accomplish those goals. 

Earth Song was written in response to the war in Iraq. The message says that despite the hardships and troubles of our world, music can always be a place of refuge. That was true for us as we were navigating what our choral program would look like, and it was true for the refugees in Ukraine as that crisis had just started. 

Fun fact: we were invited to sing at a banquet for people who donate large sums of money to Gonzaga. Thayne was in one of the tables near the front, and one of my fellow group members claims that he was in tears after we finished this song. But that was awhile ago, maybe I'm misremembering things :wink:.

*What I learned:* Make music for yourself. Collegiate music making is filled with so many competitions, concerts, retreats, and more professional gigs that many times it feels like a job. Remind yourself why you are making music and share in this beautiful artform with your friends.

## #9: If Ye Love Me (Thomas Tallis)

* Semester performed: Fall 2023 (Retreat)
* Ensemble: Concert Choir
* Check out our recording of the piece!

It's not a Trevor Top 10 Choir song list if there isn't any Renaissance music on there. If Ye Love Me by Thomas Tallis was one of the first choir songs that got me addicted to the artform in the first place. I first heard this piece covered by the Kings Singers right at lockdown and I was hooked. If you go back far enough on my Instagram, you can see me singing all four parts with myself... quite poorly though because I was young and did not know what I did not know :sweat_smile:.

Having listened to this song a lot of times, I have a very specific idea in my head about how I thought this song was supposed to go. As such, when we got ready to perform this song at the mass service for the monastery that hosts our choir retreat at the beginning of each year, I was shocked at how much Dr. Stohlmann did things... well not as I expected. The two major differences from what I had listened to were the tempo being much faster than I'm used to - every recording I listened to took it very legato. Additionally, those who listen to the Brits sing this song know that the word "sp'rit" is a hot word to pronounce, and we did not pronounce it in the English way. Having to sing through these changes really messed with my muscle memory and I had to work hard to incorporate those changes into my singing, and I grumbled after every rehearsal when we worked on this. 

Fast forward to the mass performance and I realized that the changes actually worked quite well (shocker!). Considering the space that we were in, the audience that we were singing for, and where our group was at after only 2 weeks of rehearsals, the changes made were actually quite fitting and refreshing. It was a modern take on a well-respected part of the sacred repertoire while still upholding what made the song so special. 

*What I learned:* Find new spins and ways of thinking to rejuvenate older repertoire in order to captivate the modern audience. You'd be surprised what you can get away with that still keeps everyone engaged.

## Honorable Mentions

There were so manys songs that I wish I could include on this list, but in an effort to not make this post too long some cuts had to be made. Nevertheless, here are a few songs that were really close to making the list:

* **The Music of Stillness:** Sung with Chamber Choir in Spring 2022, this song is just absolutely gorgeous. Many of you know I have mixed feelings about my preferences of Elaine Hagenberg's works, but this one is a Trevor-certified banger. This is a song that I am keeping in my repertoire for when I have my own choir, as I would love to conduct this piece.
* **Beati Quorum Via, Gaudete in Domino, My Spirit Sang All Day:** Surprisingly, no songs from my tour from Italy with the Chamber Choir made it onto this list. These 3 songs were my favorites from the ones we took on tour, and they always sounded the best in the various churches and basilicas we sang in. Gauduete in Domino was my favorite because we sang the piece in the basilica where the composer was buried!
* **Ubi Caritas (Durufle), I Wonder as I Wander (Rutter):** I didn't want this list to completely turn into Christmas music so I refrained from adding these. However, these songs are near and dear to my heart and they were an absolute blast to perform on our Candlelight Christmas concerts.
* **Will the Circle Be Unbroken:** This traditional Appilachian song was an absolute BANGER to sing. I adore this piece, and having a director who spent a decent part of her career in that culture shape the song was really inspiring. It did not make the final list because many people failed to get the song into their bodies and buy into the song, so it lost a bit of its value and impact for me because of that.

Alright, here are the top 3!

There you have it, all of my favorite pieces I sang while I was in the choirs at Gonzaga University. These songs will leave lasting memories for me for the rest of my life, and I can't wait to create even more memories during my last (???) year here at Gonzaga. Choral music is such a beautiful artform to participate in, both professionally and recreationally. I hope that if you are participating in a choir during your educational experience, you are taking advantage of every moment and keeping your mind alert to learning experiences that will benefit you beyond the classroom. When doing this, you too can look back on your choral experience in undergrad and recall all the memories that made your singing career that much more special :smile:.
