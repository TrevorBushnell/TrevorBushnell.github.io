There are many incredible stories that can - and *have* been told through choral music, from historical and religious stories that have stood the test of time to more contemporary moments in our own history. I've also enjoyed analyzing how composers take inspiration from previous composing giants in history while still adding something creative and unique to the style. As such, when I had the opportunity to talk about whatever I wanted for my final project in music theory, I thought this would be the perfect time to reflect on both of these ideas through comparing and contrasting two of my favorite choral works of all time.

Of all the music Bach wrote, many consider his *St. Matthew Passion* to be his greatest work of all time, right alongside his *St. John Passion* and *Mass in B Minor*. The *St. Matthew Passion* is a dramatic storytelling of the death of Jesus Christ from the perspective of the gospel of Matthew. It's quite an illustrious work that calls for not only a double choir (with SATB soloists representing BOTH choirs) but also a double orchestra. Since Bach was so rooted in his faith, the way his music was driven by the gravity behind the biblical passion story. I always love listening to this work because of Bach's incredible skill at crafting a story through the medium of music.

Fast forward to 2017, where Craig Hella Johnson completed and premiered his first major large scale choral work *Considering Matthew Shepard*. The work is centered around the tragic story behind Matthew Shepard. After attending a meeting of the LGBT association at the University of Wyoming, Matthew went to the fireside bar where he met Erin McKinney and Russel Henderson. Around midnight, the two men drove Matthew to a remote area, tied him to a fence, beat him, and left him to die. While he was saved and brought to the hospital, he passed away 6 days later. *Considering Matthew Shepard* is heart-wrenching as it portrays not only the death of Matthew, but also the world's reaction to his death - both the good and the bad.

Before going into detail about the discoveries that I made while analyzing these two works, I want to first go over some definitions and technical terms for those who are not familiar with large scale chorus works and the components that make up them.

For starters, both the *St. Matthew Passion* and the *St. John Passion* are considered **oratorios.** An oratorio is a large scale work meant for chorus and orchestra that is meant to tell a larger story which is generally sacred in nature. As opposed to an opera, which also is written for chorus and orchestra, an oratorio is to be performed without costumes, lighting, or staging - rather only the music in its purest form is used to communicate the story. Handel's *Messiah*, Mendelssohn's *Elijah*, and Haydn's *Creation* are all some famous examples of oratorios.

More specifically, both of these works are considered **passions.** A passion is a subset of an oratorio which depicts the suffering and crucifixion of an individual. Generally, this is in reference to Jesus Christ and uses Biblical text and poetry to re-enact this story. 

The overall form of an oratorio/passion is divided up into the four following types of movements:

*  **opening/closing chorus**: There is usually an elaborate chorus that aims to set the stage for the story to come. These choruses are much longer than other movements in the piece and are more musically elaborate. Sometimes there is also a closing chorus to wind down the work, although this is not always required. The *St. Matthew Passion* and *Considering Matthew Shepard* both have some form of closing chorus, but the *St. John Passion* does not.
* **recitative:** These are movements of spoken word. Their purpose is to serve as the main mode for telling the story. As such, the accompaniment and music is much simpler so that the focus of the audience can be diverted to the text.
* **aria:** These are solo movements that aim to embellish and reflect on the story. The type of feeling is generally determined for the audience through the choice of voice part singing the aria as well as the instrumentation underneath the soloist. While most arias are solo movements, they sometimes can also be duets or even trios.
* **chorales:** These are similar to hymn tunes that would be sung in church. In the area of Bach, chorales were meant to be songs that people had heard before.
