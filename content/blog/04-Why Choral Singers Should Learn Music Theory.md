title: "Why Choral Singers Should Learn Music Theory"
---

Throughout my collegiate choral experience at a school filled with a choral program of mostly non-music majors, most people are very foreign to music theory. Some students were music minors and thus took one year of theory their freshman or sophomore year, but didn't get super excited about it (or even hated the class). Even the music majors who are in the choir aren't actively using music theory concepts while they are rehearsing, even if they are more comfortable with the subject. 

I want to clarify - you technically do NOT need any knowledge of theory to get you through your collegiate choir experience. Unless you are a music major at a music college, chances are you can get through your college career solely on your ear or with a combination of a good ear and a basic sense of sight reading. At Gonzaga, most students in the choral program have the latter - i.e. some combination of a basic understanding of sight reading and a good ear to pick up on when they aren't fitting in with the rest of the choir. Some people are more in tune with their ears than they are with their sight reading. Others sight read first and then use their ears to spot check them. The point is that you can get very far in collegiate choir by having a basic sense of both.

However, I've noticed that the skillset that I've developed in choir has been unique compared to the rest of my colleagues. I've worked really hard to build myself as a good, well-rounded choral musician. As I've done that, I've found that there's been one thing that I've done that has single handedly contributed to the reason as to why I'm as good as I am as a choral artist and stand out among my colleagues. *I actually use music theory when I'm learning music.* 

There's more that goes into that statement than sight reading. Don't get me wrong, I'm on the better end of sight readers in the choir. However, I can name a pretty large chunk of Concert Choir that can sight read far better than me. But when I think about the number of people who are thinking about their scales as they sing, identifying key changes, locating where their part fits into the context of the chord, then I eliminate a lot of people of that better sight reader list. I've found that the skills I've developed in music theory have helped me not only learn, but understand the musical meaning in a piece much faster than anyone else in the choir. 

Having a good understanding of music theory allows you to be a more versatile singer that is capable of any job. You can't have a job as a section leader in a church choir if all you have is your ear. Most jobs hand you the music the morning of the service you are about to sing. You get potentially 1-2 run-throughs before the service to learn your music, and then you have to simply nail the music in the service. Hate to break it to you, but your ear is never going to save you their - the other singers in the church choir will be as clueless as you are and your ear is not going to be able to latch on to someone who is "correctly" singing your part. You have to be able to correctly sing your part without any help. 

Luckily, adding music theory to your musical thought process is something that can be trained and practiced. After my freshman year of choir, I realized that I was not good at all. My high school program did not prepare me for what the college singing life is like. I knew there were things I had to learn. As such, I spent the next three years learning how to sight read and the basics of music theory so that I could use it in my rehearsal process. Eventually, I got to the point where my musical output was far greater than just being able to listen for my part. I'm not like Dr. Stohlmann - I won't nail every note on a first read - but my consistency both with my notes and my understanding of how my parts fits in with context is far greater than most other singers. It's why I've had the opportunity to be able to audition into a semi-pro choir while I'm still in college and be offered church jobs without having to apply and audition for them. 

In this blog post, I want to share with you the **5 music theory concepts that I consistently use when learning new music.** Some of these will indeed be sight reading related, but some of them are general music theory concepts that go beyond just reading your notes on the page. If music theory sounds scary to you, I'll also have you know that *everything I'll talk about in this post does not go beyond a first-semester collegiate course in music theory.* This means that you can very easily learn and understand these concepts and practice them yourself in a short amount of time. If you are interested in leveling up your choral game to be able to take gigs that require a higher level of musicianship beyond that of the collegiate choral environment, then I promise you that these skills I'm about to share will take your choral game to the next level.

So what are we waiting for? Let's get into the music theory topics!

> *Note: The order that I introduce the topics matters - the further down the list we go, the more that concept relies on mastery of the previous concepts. If you are trying to learn these the first time, I would advise that you work from #1 down to #5.*
