title: "What I've Learned From Tech That I'm Applying to Music (And You Should Apply Too!)"
---

I spent 4 years studying to become a data scientist. Countless hours of readings, projects, and banging my head against a wall for hours because my code was not working. I took every statistics and data science class under the sun. I worked on my own coding projects outside of school. I even had an internship in tech as a software developer. I did my fair share in the tech world, and I was all set up for success.

What did I learn? There was not shot I was making it though a job as a data scientist. Sure I enjoyed my work... but I wasn't completely in love and immersed in what I was doing. As such, I'm glad I'm switching over to a career in choir music. 

That being said, pursuing a tech job taught me a lot about how to function in the professional world. Time management, focusing on tasks, asking for help - all of these have systems in place in the tech world that can be used to be more efficient with your work. Additionally, jobs in tech teach you how to *present yourself* in the professional world. Throughout my degree, I not only was taught the hard skills I would need on the job (i.e. math and programming) but also how to show myself as a stand-out candidate that can be hired by a company. These are skills that I learned, got better at, and am forever grateful for as they were able to get me to where I am today. 

Yet after watching my music friends, I can't help but notice a *lack of learning how to be a professional.* How do you make connections? How can you present yourself as a successful candidate that can do the job? How do you show an employer that you are worth their time? Musicians (at least from the little I've seen in the world through my Gonzaga lens) are learning incredible music skills, but aside from their talent have little to show for themselves. On a resume, they look the same as the next talented singer a few states over. 

Even though I've transitioned over to music, I've already starting using some of my professional findings from tech to set myself up for success in a career in music. In fact, I've been applying these techniques in my musical persona prior to making this my career - and it's the reason that I've had opportunities like singing in the Spokane Symphony Chorale while still being in college, being offered church jobs rather than applying to them myself, and more. As such, here are the **two biggest lessons I've learned from tech that musicians should do too.**

## Complete Your Own Personal Projects

In the tech world, companies don't only care about your ability to simply do the job. Rather, they are interested in proof that you have not only the competencies required for the job but also the ability to follow the process of a data science or other tech-related project. To do this, companies are expecting to see your *previous professional experience* (i.e., internships + jobs that you have worked) as well as **any personal projects that you have completed that are relevant to your desired job.** It's the reason why some programmers never go to college but can still get hired - the personal projects they have completed are of such high quality and relevance that it proves the candidate is capable of the work. 

I did this when I was pursuing tech - in fact, I still work on data science related projects to date! Some personal projects I've done are:

* create a website that shows all my trends in my battle data for a shooter game on my Nintendo Switch called Splatoon 3 (how often I win with certain weapons in the game, on certain stages, which weapons I perform better with, which game modes I enjoy more, etc.)
* create a programming library called `livesplit_parser` that has the ability to read and generate charts and summary statistics on speedrunning data
* wrote code to statistically prove the differences between AI and Bach choral music (haha yes it's a double dip, but it was my best project on my resume! It landed me my current job as an AI Quality Assurance tester/programmer for DataAnnotation)

Going into this year, I have plans for doing my own musical personal projects as well, such as pursuing composition and creating my own ensembles to conduct. However, rarely do I see musicians doing this in their free time. Between all the ensembles they participate in and the work they have in their individual lessons, they don't want to work on their own projects. Unfortunately, the point of personal projects is to do them *on your personal time.* As such, you have to balance building personal projects alongside your student/professional life. It doesn't have to be the equivalent of a part-time job - even simply working 2 hours/week is plenty. The point is that you have 2-4 projects going into the professional world that you can point to and say "I did this on my own time to continue doing what I love and develop my skills. And yes - I can do this!"

So what makes a good personal project? How do you choose a personal project? The topic doesn't matter, but the major point is to *choose something that you enjoy doing.* If you are going to work on a project on your own time, you will not finish it if you aren't enjoying a topic. Personal projects DON'T work if you are only completing them because it looks good for your resume. If you aren't enjoying what you are doing, you will burn out and not finish the project. 

If you know me, you know that I am in love with all things Nintendo. I speedrun many classic Mario titles, absolutely *adore* Mario Kart, and enjoy playing the spinoff titles like Splatoon and Pok√©mon: Legends Arceus. As such, my major tech projects are around the data surrounding the games that I already play. I made the Splatoon dashboard as an attempt to get better at the game - learn what weapons I was performing well at, WHY I was performing well with them, and learn how to improve in the future. The `livesplit_parser` package I currently maintain with my speedrunning friends is because we wanted to be able to spot trends in our speedruns - find out which segments of a run we were good at, poor at, and find out who is more consistent at certain parts of the run compared to others. The point is I took something I'm interested in - my gaming hobby - and created a project out of it. 

This applies for myself in my music career as well. I've founded three choral ensembles in my time at undergrad. Each ensemble shows that I am passionate about choir music and learning how to be a better performer in an ensemble setting. I hope that I can continue making ensembles in the future. 

Here are some examples of music projects that could be in line with something you enjoy doing:

* Start your own music group! It can be in line with whatever your genre/instrument is. I've seen plenty of bands start up in my time at Gonzaga (Mark Few's Keys and Zagstampede are some of my favorites in recent memory). But get your friends together and enjoy making music. Do some live shows. Put recordings on the internet. Have something to show for the music you make in your group. You can see some of the examples of [music groups that I have made](https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/choral_projects) for inspiration.
* Write your own music! The mileage here also varies depending on your interests. I'm an avid choral nerd, so I exclusively write choral music. Maybe you want to write a piano etude. Maybe your heart is with symphonies. Maybe you vibe with indie music and you write your own songs for just you and your guitar. These are all fantastic examples of personal projects involving writing your own music.
* Put on your own concert! This past semester students organized a "classical night" for the Gonzaga student body where students gathered to listen to classical music being performed live on a Wednesday evening while studying. I loved this idea and I hope more things like this happen in the future. The main idea behind this is to come up with a theme and perform some music on it! Additionally, invite friends and colleagues to participate on the program too. If someone wants to steal this idea, doing something like this on Gonzaga's campus with musical theater would be a **fantastic** project, especially considering the number of people who love musical theater in GU choirs and the lack of presence it has here compared to other universities.

This is not an exhaustive list - maybe there are other music projects that come to mind that you enjoy doing! Just work on something on your own that you are passionate about. This shows that you are passionate about the subject area and that you can do all aspects of the work required, not just the musical skills.

Something else worth noting is that you don't always have to come up with your own projects! In fact, **it's okay to count a project as participating in someone else's idea.** For example, everyone who participated in my Bach AI choir could use it as a project opportunity to improve their musical experiences. The key is that you have proof of yourself working on something on your own time, regardless of who came up with the idea. 



## Create A Digital and Sharable Portfolio of Your Work

Alright so you have some personal projects under your belt, but now what? Your gut reaction might be to immediately put all of these projects on your resume. After all, your resume is the place to show off your skills and your experience. If projects equally count as experience, then they should be featured on your resume alongside your other work experience to show off the best version of yourself, right?

**WRONG!** Well, kind of. It's slightly more complicated than a flat-out "No."

In general, you should not have projects completely cloud up your resume. Resumes are generally expected to be short - especially for young professionals like ourselves entering into the space. The general rule I've heard is that your resume is one page of content for each decade that you've worked. That means all our resumes need to strive to be roughly a page in length. As you do more projects, you start running out of space on your resume to highlight all of your projects leaving room to additionally talk about your education and experience. 

Personal portfolio websites are the way around this. The point of a portfolio website is to *spend in-depth time explaining the various projects and professional experiences that you have, as well as what interests you!* The major benefit that a personal portfolio gives you is that you aren't constrained by a set page or word limit - it's your website so you can write as much or as little as you want. This gives you the freedom to talk about your projects in a way that's fulfilling and enjoyable for you. Additionally, with all this information external and linked on your resume, employers can then have the choice as to whether they want to learn more about the work that you have involved yourself in. In my experience applying for jobs and doing interviews, more people than I expected had taken the time to at least skim through my website and probe for questions about my projects. It definitely doesn't hurt to have ready at your finger tips.

If you are worried that having a personal site is too arrogant or outgoing, remember that the goal is to sell yourself as a worthy candidate! In order to do this well, you need to be able to communicate our successes in an effective manner, no matter how "big" or "small" you think your experiences are. Sure, there's ways to poorly write our success to sound like arrogance, but use the right tone and you can avoid coming across in that fashion. If that's something you are worried about, have someone you trust read through your writing to check your tone.

This website does *not* need to be elaborate. You do not have to know how to code in order to make a website, nor do you have to pay for a domain with your name in it. There are many tools online that allow you to create websites for free as well as give you a domain for free (even if it has the company name attached to the end of it). My personal favorite website building tool that I have used in the past is Google Sites, but Wix and Weebly are also fantastic options. If you are interested in coding your own website, there are many platforms that will host your website from the code you write such as Hostinger and Netifly. My current coding setup uses the Hugo framework and gets deployed using GitHub Pages - both are free options too. And yes, I don't have my own domain purchased - GitHub sits in my URL :smile:.

Once you decide on a platform for building your website, you should at a minimum include the following pages on your personal site:

#### A Catchy Landing Page

Catch people's eye and peak people's interest with something fun right on the front page! Here, information should be short and informative. Give a 2-3 sentence description of yourself (what you are studying, year in school, etc.) and then include another 2-3 sentences describing your interests in your field of study. You can refer to my landing page as an example of how I do this.

#### An In-depth List of Your Projects

Create a separate page/tab on your website that lets you talk about your projects. Here, you should list out every project that you have completed. Include the following information for each project:

* A brief description of what the project was about
* What tools/skills you used in order to complete the project
* What you learned in the process of completing the project

You can list out all of your projects on the same page, or you can separate them out into blog post sub-pages. This portfolio site leaves all my projects (shy my compositions) on the same main page. My tech portfolio separates all my projects out into sub pages. It's up to you to decide which one you prefer :wink:.

#### A Biography

Type up a biography about yourself, including all your experience, relevant information about yourself, and things you enjoy doing outside of work. This should be more detailed than your home page - we should really get a good understanding of who you are from your biography. If you need examples of good biographies, Google your favorite professor and read what they have on the school's website (it should be one of the first hits when you search your professor's name). I've seen biographies vary in length between professors - some are multiple paragraphs and some are condensed into one meaty paragraph. Write a biography that shows off you in a way that makes you feel proud of you and what you have done!

#### A Contact Page

It's always nice to have a way for people to reach out and connect with you. Sure, maybe few people actually use this, but in the off-chance that people do you'll be glad you have it. At a minimum you should link a personal email address that you check regularly and a link to your LinkedIn profile. If you have other social medias that show off your work and your projects, you can include them here too. I personally have content on my GitHub and YouTube profiles, so I choose to link those in my contact page. 

Pro-tip: Hyper-link everything as much as possible! Don't make people have to copy/paste URLs. Additionally, you should hyperlink your email address using the format `mailto:[YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE]`. When the user clicks on your email hyperlink, a new email automatically addressed to you will open in the user's default email application.

#### Optional Features That Can Be Nice To Have!

Upon looking at other people's personal portfolios, here are some ideas that you can include on your website but will not make or break the portfolio:

* **Get some high quality professional portraits:** If people are going to be reading a lot about you, you might as well give them some pictures of you looking pretty. I did a whole photoshoot for portrait photos because the last time I got photos like that were for my senior pictures in high school about 5 years ago. You definitely don't need to go out and do an entire photoshoot like I did, but accumulating multiple nice pictures of yourself rather than just a single portrait photo makes a nice aesthetic difference. 
* **Include your resume:** I have mixed feelings about this one, but wanted to include it since most people choose to do this. This doesn't need to be elaborate, a button that upon clicking downloads your resume will suffice. I personally do not share my resume on any of my portfolio sites because I explain all the same content on the site itself. The inclusion of this ultimately is up to you.

#### How to Share Your Portfolio Site

Now that your portfolio site is finished, how do you share it with others? At a minimum, **include the link to your portfolio in your resume header**. Mine looks like this:

![](/images/blogs/02/resume-header.png)

By putting the portfolio link here, employers can easily find your portfolio and are more inclined to click and explore. You can also link your portfolio on your LinkedIn profile and your social medias. I link my portfolio in my Instagram bio, but that's really only because I have this blog that I'm also trying to promote. But it's your site - no one is stopping you from sharing it in whatever capacity you wish!

## Build Your Connections

I left this to the end because everyone says this all the time, but this couldn't be further from the truth. The more music people you know, the more likely you will get involved professionally in the musical community. I got my first church job because one of my friends from choir - she was already serving as the Alto section leader and asked me to come because they were looking for a sub tenor. Turns out I did a great job and that tenor ended up leaving, so I just kept showing up. I also started singing in the Spokane Symphony Chorale because Dr. Stohlmann invited me since she knew me as a student. There have been plenty of other musical opportunities that have come about because of the people I know both on Gonzaga's campus and in the greater Spokane community. I've also tried to share that same wealth with my peers by asking or recommending friends to sing at various church jobs and other engagements as I've heard of openings. 

That being said, I included this at the end because while it is possible to get by with just your connections, *the reason I was offered my connections was because of the other experiences that I had crafted for myself.* Dr. Stohlmann knew me as a student and how I functioned in the classroom sure, but there were a few other tenors at the time that could have done it. However, I had repeatedly shown my enthusiasm for choir in and out not just through my engagement in class and conversations with her, but by doing things like helping participate in the Glee Club and my work with my ensemble Concordanza. Additionally, my short list of people that I recommend for various jobs is not just everyone I know - it typically stems from people whom I have seen engage in ways beyond just "being good" and going through the motions in choir. 

The bottom line is this: **the projects that you start will only help you in finding and strengthening your network.** You'll also find that your network will grow and expand faster because of the projects that you do - maybe the people you meet will be inspired and intrigued by your work! But yes... be sure that you are doing things like going to the conferences, participating in the leadership activities, and going to other events where you would meet other people and teachers... but who hasn't been encouraged to do that already :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:.



## Conclusion

I think it's important to establish your professional identity before you enter into the professional space. Maintaining a presence on LinkedIn and writing a resume to give to employers is the norm and is not enough to set you apart from other candidates. By doing the things above, I promise that you will have an easier time finding success in your musical endeavors. Don't expect success to come to you immediately - trust me I've had my fair number of rejections in my professional life thus-far. However, doing these things will help you stand out among other musical candidates when you eventually apply for jobs in the professional space.

If you have any questions about building a professional presence, and/or you have ideas for a musical project and you would like to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always ears for anything and everything music related for others :wink:.
