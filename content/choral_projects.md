## Bach AI Choir (Spring 2024)

As a part of my honors thesis project for my undergrad degree, the Bach AI choir was a chamber ensemble made up of singers from Gonzaga's Concert Choir singing various AI generated Bach chorales. The ensemble sang on my lecture recital aimed at highlighting the differences between Bach and AI choral music and showcasing why choral singing is fundamentally a human artform.

I had an absolute blast teaching and conducting AI generated music. It was an incredible challenge - both for the singers and for myself - due to the lack of structure and understanding of phrasing by the AI.

## Concordanza

Concordanza was an eight-person choral a capella group inspired by Voces8. Created in the height of the pandemic, I wanted more opportunities to be able to simply sing and enjoy. Additionally, we had just lost our choral director that school year. Many of my peers wanted a chance to sing purely for enjoyment - to express our feelings and grief as well as the grief of others in the world. The group sang many choral a capella pieces, and even got a chance to perform at a Gonzaga sponsored dinner for large donors of the school.

## The ZagTags

Fun story - at the end of our choir trip to Italy, about half the tenors and basses had a 6AM departure flight. On a whim, we decided to pull an all-nighter before heading to the airport. While we were enjoying our last night in Italy, a bunch of us on a whim mentioned barbershop music and we all thought "Hey, why not start a barbershop quartet?"

Well, barbershop we didn't explicitly do, but sing together we did. The ZagTags was a tenor-bass quartet that performed a wide variety of repertoire, from pop to barbershop to even classical music. The group was featured at every choir concert in my senior year of undergrad. Additionally, the group was invited to provide entertainment for various student and community activities throughout the year. We even got the opportunity to perform a work by Gonzaga composition student Lily Franklin (c/o 2027) for the music department's NASM accreditation recital.
