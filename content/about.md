Trevor Bushnell is an aspiring secondary music educator from Spokane, WA. Raised on the west coast of Washington, Trevor learned about his talent for singing through participating in musical theater productions playing roles like Jack Scott from *High School Musical*, the Tin Man in *The Wizard of Oz*, and Uncle Fester from *The Addams Family.*

Upon arriving to Gonzaga, Trevor fell in love with the art form of choral music. Throughout his time at Gonzaga, Trevor sang with various choral ensembles, including the Concert Choir (auditioned SATB choir), Chamber Choir (now Vocal Arts Ensemble), and served as student leadership behind the revival of the historic Gonzaga Glee Club (non-auditioned TTBB choir). Highlight works include being a featured soloist in the *Missa Criolla* (Spring 2021) and Bach's *Magnificat* (Spring 2022). In Spring 2023, Trevor travelled to Italy with the Chamber Choir doing outreaches with local high schools and performing in various churches, including the historic Duomo cathedral in Florence. Trevor has also had the opportunity to perform at various music conferences, including in the collegiate honor choir at Northwest ACDA and as a standalone concert session with the Concert Choir at the 2025 Northwest NafMe conference. 

Trevor has also founded many choral groups throughout his undergraduate years, including Concordanza (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023), an a capella group inspired by Voces8 and the King's Singers, and the ZagTags (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024), a tenor-bass quartet singing a wide variety of styles of music. Trevor also conducted a choir to sing AI generated Bach chorales and a treble choir made up of singers from Concert Choir to premiere many of his choral works, including [Be Still My Soul](http://trevorbushnell.github.io/compositions/be-still-my-soul-ssaa/) for treble choir and [Inner Voices](http://trevorbushnell.github.io/compositions/inner-voices-satb) for mixed choir. The treble choir went on to premiere Be Still My Soul work both on Gonzaga's campus as well as at the Poetry to Music fundraiser concert for the Spokane Symphony in Spring 2024. From Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, Trevor served as the Assistant Conductor for the Gonzaga choral program, where he assisted in directing the Glee Club and Musea Treble Chorus and served as cover condutor for Concert Choir. 

Trevor received a degree in Statistics in Spring 2024 and a Music degree with a concentration in Choral Conducting in Spring 2025 from Gonzaga University. His mentors include [Dr. Meg Stohlmann](https://www.gonzaga.edu/college-of-arts-sciences/faculty-listing/detail/meg-stohlmann-dma-2aee1f77) for music education and [Dr. Michael Kropf](http://www.michaelkropfmusic.com/) for composition. 

Trevor is also a professional singer in the greater Spokane area. He currently serves as church musician - both in the choir and as a cantor and soloist - at St. Stevens Episcopal Church. Trevor is also an active member of the Spokane Symphony Chorale where he has performed many illustrious choral works, including three performances of Handel's *Messiah*, Vaughn William's *A Sea Symphony*, Beethoven's classic *9th Symphony*, Haydn's *Creation*, and more. Trevor is also the assistant conductor with the local Spokane barbershop chorus [Lilac City Voices](https://lilaccityvoices.org/). Finally, Trevor sings lead with the new barbershop quartet Odd Men Out. The quartet regularly performs many of Trevor's charts, most recently including an arrangement of I Get Around by the Beach Boys.

When not being addicted to choral music, you can find Trevor beating everyone at a game of Mario Kart or Smash Bros, out on the courts playing pickleball, or playing board and card games with his friends and family.
