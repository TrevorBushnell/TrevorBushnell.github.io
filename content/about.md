Trevor Bushnell is an aspiring secondary music educator from Spokane, WA. Raised on the west coast of Washington, Trevor learned about his talent for singing through participating in musical theater productions playing roles like Jack Scott from *High School Musical*, the Tin Man in *The Wizard of Oz*, and Uncle Fester from *The Addams Family.*

Upon arriving to Gonzaga, Trevor fell in love with the art form of choral music. Throughout his time at Gonzaga, Trevor sang with many ensembles at Gonzaga, including the Concert Choir (auditioned SATB choir), Chamber Choir (now Vocal Arts Ensemble), and served as student leadership behind the revival of the historic Gonzaga Glee Club (non-auditioned TTBB choir). Highlight works include being one of the soloists in the *Missa Criolla* (Spring 2021) and the Bach *Magnificat* (Spring 2022). In Spring 2023, Trevor travelled to Italy with the Chamber Choir doing outreaches with local high schools and performing in various churches, including the historic Duomo cathedral. 

Trevor has also founded many choral groups throughout his undergraduate years, including Concordanza (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023), an a capella group inspired by Voces8 and the King's Singers, and the ZagTags (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024), a tenor-bass quartet singing a wide variety of styles of music. In his last semester of undergad, Trevor also founded and conducted a choir to sing AI generated Bach chorales and a treble choir to premiere his first choir work, an arrangement of the hymn "Be Still My Soul." The treble choir went on to premiere his work both on Gonzaga's campus as well as for a fundraiser for the Spokane Symphony.

Trevor graduated with a degree in Statistics in Spring 2024 from Gonzaga University. He has now pivoted to a career in music education. He's currently pursuing his Masters degree in Secondary Education (Choral focus) where he is learning about conducting and choral educator practices from Dr. Meg Stohlmann. He's also an active choral composer, studying under Dr. Michael Kropf. 

When not pursuing academic studies, Trevor is a professional singer in the greater Spokane area. He's sung for various community choirs in Spokane. He also serves a church musician position at St. Stevens Episcopal Church as well as substituting at various churches around Spokane. Trevor also is an active member of the Spokane Symphony Chorale where he has performed many illustrious choral works, including two performances of Handel's *Messiah*, Vaughn William's *A Sea Symphony*, Beethoven's *9th Symphony*, and more. 

When not being addicted to music, you can find Trevor beating everyone at a game of Mario Kart, out on the courts playing pickleball, or enjoying choral music from groups such as Voces8, the King's Singers, Chanticleer, Conspirare, and more.
