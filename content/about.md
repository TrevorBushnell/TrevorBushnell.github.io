Trevor Bushnell is an aspiring secondary music educator from Spokane, WA. Raised on the west coast of Washington, Trevor learned about his talent for singing through participating in musical theater productions playing roles like Jack Scott from *High School Musical*, the Tin Man in *The Wizard of Oz*, and Uncle Fester from *The Addams Family.*

Upon arriving to Gonzaga, Trevor fell in love with the art form of choral music. Throughout his time at Gonzaga, Trevor sang with various choral ensembles, including the Concert Choir (auditioned SATB choir), Chamber Choir (now Vocal Arts Ensemble), and served as student leadership behind the revival of the historic Gonzaga Glee Club (non-auditioned TTBB choir). Highlight works include being a featured soloist in the *Missa Criolla* (Spring 2021) and Bach's *Magnificat* (Spring 2022). In Spring 2023, Trevor travelled to Italy with the Chamber Choir doing outreaches with local high schools and performing in various churches, including the historic Duomo cathedral in Florence. 

Trevor has also founded many choral groups throughout his undergraduate years, including Concordanza (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023), an a capella group inspired by Voces8 and the King's Singers, and the ZagTags (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024), a tenor-bass quartet singing a wide variety of styles of music. In his last semester of undergad, Trevor also conducted a choir to sing AI generated Bach chorales and a treble choir made up of singers from Concert Choir to premiere his first choir work, an arrangement of the hymn "Be Still My Soul." The treble choir went on to premiere his work both on Gonzaga's campus as well as at the Poetry to Music fundraiser for the Spokane Symphony in Spring 2024.

Trevor received a degree in Statistics in Spring 2024 from Gonzaga University. He's currently a post-baccalaureate at Gonzaga working towards a BA in Music, where he is learning about conducting and choral education practices from [Dr. Meg Stohlmann](https://www.gonzaga.edu/college-of-arts-sciences/faculty-listing/detail/meg-stohlmann-dma-2aee1f77) and serving as the student conductor for Gonzaga Choirs. He's also an active choral composer currently studying under [Dr. Michael Kropf](http://www.michaelkropfmusic.com/). 

When not pursuing academic studies, Trevor is a professional singer in the greater Spokane area. He currently serves a church musician - both in the choir and as a cantor and soloist - at St. Stevens Episcopal Church. Trevor is also an active member of the Spokane Symphony Chorale where he has performed many illustrious choral works, including two performances of Handel's *Messiah*, Vaughn William's *A Sea Symphony*, Beethoven's classic *9th Symphony*, and more. Finally, Trevor sings with the local Spokane barbershop chorus [Lilac City Voices](https://lilaccityvoices.org/).

When not being addicted to choral music, you can find Trevor beating everyone at a game of Mario Kart or Smash Bros, out on the courts playing pickleball, or streaming his progress on speedrunning and open-source development.
