#### About
The opportunity to combine vocal styles is something I don’t see enough in choral music. I’m inspired by composers like Rob Dietz and Jennifer Lucy Cook who find unique ways to integrate the pop sound into a traditional choral environment. However, there are very few choral works that combine traditional classical singing with the barbershop style (if at all). Since barbershop has also been a very formative part of my musical experience, I wanted to write a piece that combines those two styles. However, I wanted to find a song that would fit in both genres.

Amazing Grace is almost the unspoken American national anthem. While it’s performed in both sacred and secular settings, I find that anyone regardless of their worldview can find a connection to the song. While we may not think we need to be “saved,” everyone in the world most certainly deserves grace for their actions. This song is a great way to reflect upon that and work on this with other people. 

While I say that this piece combines the barbershop style with classical music, many hardcore barbershoppers will find that the sounds I choose to explore do not always “sound barbershoppy.” Sure, I included some dominant chord action, but it’s not littered throughout the piece like a traditional chart would be. Rather, I chose to use the voices of someone who would traditionally sing barbershop, but encourage them to sing with a fuller and richer sound by building that directly into the harmonies. The choir then compromises at the end by helping the quartet finish out the song with a tag typical of a closer in any barbershop chart  - complete with the iv6 to I penultimate cadence action and everything! Plus let’s be real - who doesn’t love a good ‘ole barbershop tag?!

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound \
That saved a wretch like me! \
I once was lost, but now am found; \
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, \
And grace my fears relieved; \
How precious did that grace appear \
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils and snares, \
I have already come; \
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, \
And grace will lead me home.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years, \
Bright shining as the sun, \
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise \
Than when we’d first begun.
