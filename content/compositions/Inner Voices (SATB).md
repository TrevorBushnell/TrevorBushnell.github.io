#### About

When I first began writing this piece, I had just started my fifth year of my undergraduate degree. The previous May I walked across the stage fully anticipating to receive a BS in Applied Mathematics and move on with life to a big boy job in data science. But something about choir lurked in the back of my brain, and I felt called to pursue a degree in choral conducting.

However, this massive shift came with tremendous mental strain. The first month of being back in school was incredibly difficult for me and my mental health. Every time I was asked to teach in order to get as much exposure as possible to teaching, my brain would consistently freeze and I would feel like I forgot how to do everything. I told myself many times that I was not capable of being able to do this - I almost dropped out right before the semester started. This mental barrier also started affecting my life outside of teaching, and I started to lose friendships that I had held dear to me prior to this life change.

About a month into school, I just completely broke down. In a frenzied attempt to try and feel better, I wrote a journal entry. I wasnâ€™t sure how to do it (I normally hate writing), but I was hoping that putting something on the page would help me feel better. The end result was a long list of terrible things I told myself in my head, but also some positive messages in an attempt to help me feel better. After stepping back and looking at the list, I realized that this was the text for the next choral piece I wanted to write.

We all struggle with mental health. We all struggle with imposter syndrome to some degree. I wanted to write a choral piece that reflects these challenges that we all face every day. The piece starts with recreating the overwhelming feeling that your mind experiences when you tell yourself the negative self-talk, but then shifts to a serene feeling with positive messages that everyone should hear. My hope is that the positive messages settle effectively and heal your soul and your mind as they healed mine when I wrote this piece.
