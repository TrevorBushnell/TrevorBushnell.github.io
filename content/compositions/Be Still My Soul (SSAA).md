#### About
My first introduction to choral music was through this beautiful melody written by Jean Sibelius. As someone who has struggled with Asperger’s syndrome his entire life, I’ve had many challenging situations in my life that go unnoticed by most people. Since I’ve worked hard to overcome my mental struggles, many people write me off when I make a social mistake and don’t understand that many times I genuinely have no idea what I’ve done is wrong or hurtful. This constant struggle when I make mistakes wears on me, even after I’ve done the work to rectify the situation. It’s hard and challenging and I often feel overwhelmed and alone.

Whenever I get overwhelmed, Be Still My Soul is the hymn I constantly return to in order to calm myself down. As such, I wanted to write my own arrangement of the song that I could have for my own solace. The music features the constant internal struggles that I feel through tight, boxed-in harmonies and the constant play between the F major and D minor chords that make up a majority of the harmonies of the second verse.

#### Text

Be still, my soul! the Lord is on your side; \
With patience bear the cross of grief or pain; \
Leave to your God to order and provide; \
In ev'ry change he faithful will remain. \
Be still, my soul! your best, your heav’nly friend \
Thru' thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul! the hour is hast'ning on \
When we shall be forever with the Lord, \
When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone, \
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored. \
Be still my soul! when change and tears are past, \
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

Be still, my soul! when dearest friends depart \
And all is darkened in the vale of tears, \
Then shall you better know his love, his heart, \
Who comes to soothe your sorrow and your fears. \
Be still, my soul! your Jesus can repay \
From his own fullness all he takes away.
