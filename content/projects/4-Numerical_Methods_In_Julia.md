title: "Numerical Methods in Julia"

While I really enjoyed my Numerical Methods class that I took for my math major, I found many frustrations with the programming language of choice: MATLAB. Sure, MATLAB has an intuitive plotting system and it's great for linear algebra operations. However, it frustrates me that it's a paid language (and not cheap either!) and its syntax took some getting adjusting to. However, there's a new programming language that I think is the new MATLAB - Julia. 

Julia is a programming language that is as intuitive as Python, as wicked-fast as C, has the mathematical computation tools like MATLAB, and has incredible statistical features as R. Sounds too good to be true? Surprisingly it's not. Julia is actually significantly faster than Python, has a syntax that feels like a blend between MATLAB and Python, and has all the tools needed to do data science and stats tasks, including machine learning. Not to mention, the language is open source, so it costs **nothing** to use. I think that every mathematician should learn and use this language, but the language is too new for it to catch on in the short term future. This is the driving reason for maintaining this project - I want to get mathematicians exposed to Julia, and maybe use Julia instead of MATLAB.
