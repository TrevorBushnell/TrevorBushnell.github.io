One technology that I have discovered while working at my previous internship was **self sovereign identity.** With this technology, the idea of being able to verify your identity on the internet in a secure fashion has become a reality. While this is very unrelated to data science, I find this technology quite fascinating. To explore this technology further, I decided to create a very basic website that lets you log in to your account using a private online credential rather than a traditional email/password setup. This project helped me understand more about this new technology as well as get me more passionate about identity verification as a whole.

Tasks include:

* Use Python and Flask to deploy a simple web app
* Utilize a 3rd party SDK called Trinsic to help speed up the process of setting up a self-sovereign identity verification system
* Have conversations with the CEO of Trinsic to further understand and improve the SDK
