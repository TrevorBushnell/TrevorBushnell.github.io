title: "New Super Mario Bros Bingo Board Generators"
---

A popular choice for gamers is to pick a game and race to complete a bingo of various challenges. While these generators exist for some New Super Mario Bros games, there was a demand for a bingo board generator for the rest of the games. While this was a very simple project to develop (only took an hour or two to complate both), I was excited to see myself code with a purpose and an end user. While this project is now deprecated since the games were incorporated on [bingosync](https://bingosync.com/), I'm still proud of the impact that I had with my first project. 

Tasks included:

* Working with top players of New Super Mario Bros games to generate a long goals list
* Randomly select 25 goals from the goals list to place in a 5-by-5 bingo card
* Provide access to the JSON so that users could copy the board into bingosync so that all players can see and mark the same card
