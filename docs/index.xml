      <description>In the recent months since my career decision, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending lots of time reflecting on the positive experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had through my first bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree at Gonzaga. It&amp;rsquo;s been a great way to calm myself down about the change to come and remind myself that these last four years have not been a waste. In my time reflecting I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of the many memories and fantastic songs I&amp;rsquo;ve had the honor to sing.</description>

      <description>I spent 4 years studying to become a data scientist. Countless hours of readings, projects, and banging my head against a wall for hours because my code was not working. I took every statistics and data science class under the sun. I worked on my own coding projects outside of school. I even had an internship in tech as a software developer. I did my fair share in the tech world, and I was all set up for success.</description>

      <description>Bach AI Choir (Spring 2024) As a part of my honors thesis project for my undergrad degree, the Bach AI choir was a chamber ensemble made up of singers from Gonzaga&amp;rsquo;s Concert Choir singing various AI generated Bach chorales. The ensemble sang on my lecture recital aimed at highlighting the differences between Bach and AI choral music and showcasing why choral singing is fundamentally a human artform.&#xA;I had an absolute blast teaching and conducting AI generated music.</description>

      <description>Be Still My Soul (SSAA) My first introduction to choral music was through this beautiful melody written by Jean Sibelius. As someone who has struggled with Asperger&amp;rsquo;s syndrome his entire life, I&amp;rsquo;ve had many challenging situations in my life that go unnoticed by most people. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to overcome my mental struggles, many people write me off when I make a social mistake and don&amp;rsquo;t understand that many times I genuinely have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;ve done is wrong or hurtful.</description>
