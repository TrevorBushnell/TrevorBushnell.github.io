      <description>Bach AI Choir (Spring 2024) As a part of my honors thesis project for my undergrad degree, the Bach AI choir was a chamber ensemble made up of singers from Gonzaga&amp;rsquo;s Concert Choir singing various AI generated Bach chorales. The ensemble sang on my lecture recital aimed at highlighting the differences between Bach and AI choral music and showcasing why choral singing is fundamentally a human artform.&#xA;I had an absolute blast teaching and conducting AI generated music.</description>

      <description>There are many incredible stories that can - and have been told through choral music, from historical and religious stories that have stood the test of time to more contemporary moments in our recent memory. I&amp;rsquo;ve also enjoyed analyzing how composers take inspiration from previous composing giants in history while still adding something creative and unique to the style. As such, when I had the opportunity to talk about whatever I wanted for my final project in music theory, I thought this would be the perfect moment to reflect on both of these ideas through comparing and contrasting two of my favorite choral works of all time.</description>

      <description>In the recent months since my career decision, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending lots of time reflecting on the positive experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had through my first bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree at Gonzaga. It&amp;rsquo;s been a great way to calm myself down about the change to come and remind myself that these last four years have not been a waste. In my time reflecting I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of the many memories and fantastic songs I&amp;rsquo;ve had the honor to sing.</description>

      <description>I spent 4 years studying to become a data scientist. Countless hours of readings, projects, and banging my head against a wall for hours because my code was not working. I took every statistics and data science class under the sun. I worked on my own coding projects outside of school. I even had an internship in tech as a software developer. I did my fair share in the tech world, and I was all set up for success.</description>

      <description>Score Preview &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Amazing Grace PERUSAL SCORE About The opportunity to combine vocal styles is something I don’t see enough in choral music. I’m inspired by composers like Rob Dietz and Jennifer Lucy Cook who find unique ways to integrate the pop sound into a traditional choral environment. However, there are very few choral works that combine traditional classical singing with the barbershop style (if at all). Since barbershop has also been a very formative part of my musical experience, I wanted to write a piece that combines those two styles.</description>

      <description>Recordings Score Preview &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Be Still My Soul PERUSAL SCORE About My first introduction to choral music was through this beautiful melody written by Jean Sibelius. As someone who has struggled with Asperger’s syndrome his entire life, I’ve had many challenging situations in my life that go unnoticed by most people. Since I’ve worked hard to overcome my mental struggles, many people write me off when I make a social mistake and don’t understand that many times I genuinely have no idea what I’ve done is wrong or hurtful.</description>

      <description>Silver medal winner in the Composition division of MusicFest Northwest 2025&#xA;Recordings Score Preview &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Inner Voices PERUSAL SCORE About When I first began writing this piece, I had just started my fifth year of my undergraduate degree. The previous May I walked across the stage fully anticipating to receive a BS in Applied Mathematics and move on with life to a big boy job in data science. But something about choir lurked in the back of my brain, and I felt called to pursue a degree in choral conducting.</description>
