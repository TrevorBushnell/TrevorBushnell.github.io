      <description>All of my notes for classes, YouTube videos, and more that I learn from using data science get compiled into this repository. All of these resources are public and completely free, so pull, yoink, and twist to your hearts content :)

      <title>Gonzaga Choirs Digital Library: A Webapp</title>
      <link>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/9-gu_choirs_digital_library/</link>

      <description>While I can&amp;rsquo;t link the source code because of the private information being managed, I built an online webapp and small database for managing our entire choral catalog for all the choirs at Gonzaga per the direction of our director Dr. Meg Stohlmann. This was a satisfying project for me because I was able to combine my love of programming and problem solving with choir. The final project is able to serve the choral community long after I graduate college.</description>

      <title>Honors Thesis: Analyzing the Singability of Choir AI</title>
      <link>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/8-singable_ai_bach/</link>

      <guid>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/8-singable_ai_bach/</guid>
      <description>This was my first data science project. It was created and presented as my final project in my CPSC222: Intro to Data Science class. In 2021, I was invested in improving my typing speeds. Since I had so much typing data, I was interested in seeing what my progress was like over time.
 See the status of the project here
 Tasks included:
 Listen to many Bach compositions and do research to figure out what makes Bach unique Find, train, and run Bach AI models on my machine Use my music theory and data science skills to analyze the differences between AI Bach and real Bach compositions Write a paper/website that explains all the discoveries that I made Direct a chamber choir of music and honors students from Gonzaga university to perform the AI Music in March 2024  </description>

      <title>League of Legends Project</title>

      <guid>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/3-league_project/</guid>
      <description>This was a team project where I worked with Ben Lombardi (Gonzaga class of 2023) to see if we could figure out the winning player in a League of Legends match based on data collected in the first 10 minutes of the match. This project was completed for my CPSC322: Data Science Algorithms class.
 Check out the report
 Tasks included:
 Communicating with team members to develop a cohesive project and presentation Build popular machine learning algorithms (kNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) by hand Produce visualizations that helped provide insights into the dataset and helped us choose what attributes to train on Communicated these insights in the form of a report and presented the findings to the class and professor  </description>

 Tasks included:
 Scraping for my data on the typing test website I used (the data was not easily downloadable at the time I did this project) Creating visualizations that showed my typing improvements over time Developed a simple machine learning model that predicted the threshold of my typing speeds based on other typing factors Communicated these insights in the form of a report and presented my findings to the class and professor  </description>

      <title>New Super Mario Bros Bingo Board Generators</title>
      <link>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/1-nsmb_bingo_generators/</link>

      <guid>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/1-nsmb_bingo_generators/</guid>
      <description>A popular choice for gamers is to pick a game and race to complete a bingo of various challenges. While these generators exist for some New Super Mario Bros games, there was a demand for a bingo board generator for the rest of the games. While this was a very simple project to develop (only took an hour or two to complate both), I was excited to see myself code with a purpose and an end user.</description>

      <title>Numerical Methods in Julia</title>
      <link>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/4-numerical_methods_in_julia/</link>

      <description>While I really enjoyed my Numerical Methods class that I took for my math major, I found many frustrations with the programming language of choice: MATLAB. Sure, MATLAB has an intuitive plotting system and it&amp;rsquo;s great for linear algebra operations. However, it frustrates me that it&amp;rsquo;s a paid language (and not cheap either!) and its syntax took some getting adjusting to. However, there&amp;rsquo;s a new programming language that I think is the new MATLAB - Julia.</description>

      <description>I absolutely adore LaTeX, and I use it in combination with Jupyter notebooks and Markdown to type most of my notes in my STEM classes. These notes are completely open source and free for anyone to use. You are also welcome to contribute to the notes base if you so choose!

      <title>Trinsic Login Demo</title>

      <description>One technology that I have discovered while working at my previous internship was self sovereign identity. With this technology, the idea of being able to verify your identity on the internet in a secure fashion has become a reality. While this is very unrelated to data science, I find this technology quite fascinating. To explore this technology further, I decided to create a very basic website that lets you log in to your account using a private online credential rather than a traditional email/password setup.</description>

      <title>Why Travis Scott</title>
      <link>https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/projects/10-why_travis_scott/</link>

      <description>My friends know that I am such a choir nerd and exclusively listen to choir on Spotify. As such, it was a massive surprise when I looked at my 2023 Spotify Wrapped to find that my #2 artist for the year was Travis Scott. I was shocked and bewildered - how does a rapper make it into my Spotify Wrapped surrounded by multitudes of choir music? To figure some things out, I asked for my Spotify data and did a short data science project looking for my findings.</description>
