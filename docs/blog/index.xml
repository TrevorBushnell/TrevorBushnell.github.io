      <description>In the recent months since my career decision, I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending lots of time reflecting on the positive experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had through my first bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree at Gonzaga. It&amp;rsquo;s been a great way to calm myself down about the change to come and remind myself that these last four years have not been a waste. In my time reflecting I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of the many memories and fantastic songs I&amp;rsquo;ve had the honor to sing.</description>

      <description>I spent 4 years studying to become a data scientist. Countless hours of readings, projects, and banging my head against a wall for hours because my code was not working. I took every statistics and data science class under the sun. I worked on my own coding projects outside of school. I even had an internship in tech as a software developer. I did my fair share in the tech world, and I was all set up for success.</description>

      <description>Throughout my collegiate choral experience at a school filled with a choral program of mostly non-music majors, most people are very foreign to music theory. Some students were music minors and thus took one year of theory their freshman or sophomore year, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get super excited about it (or even hated the class). Even the music majors who are in the choir aren&amp;rsquo;t actively using music theory concepts while they are rehearsing, even if they are more comfortable with the subject.</description>
