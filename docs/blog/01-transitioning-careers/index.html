    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Hi there! If you are reading this, then chances are you&rsquo;ve heard in some way or another about my recent life update&hellip; but yes the rumors have now been worked into reality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I am now pursuing a career as a choral director!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited about this opportunity to actually pursue what I want and continue to get to encourage others to continue singing as a form of artistic expression.</p>
<p>The goal of the rest of this first blog is to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk about WHY I want to make this drastic change from tech to arts</li>
<li>Talk about what I&rsquo;ve been up to the last roughly 5 weeks since &ldquo;graduation&rdquo; (and have a chance to explain where I&rsquo;m at academically and more importantly <em>why</em> I made that choice)</li>
<li>Talk about the possible paths that I have and <em>where</em> I see myself going in the future</li>
<li>Talk about what I&rsquo;m going to be up to this academic year, as well as some of my goals for this coming year</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-even-do-this">Why Even Do This?</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a few major developments that I have realized.</p>
<p>Tech is not going to hold my attention span for long enough. I could work a data science job now - honestly really enjoy it - but I can tell with how much I engage with my data science work now that I would get tired of it after a few years and seek something new.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also had some fantastic mentors in recent memory. Dr. Stohlmann is hands down my favorite educator that&rsquo;s been in my life to date, and from talking with friends I know I&rsquo;m not the only one that shares that sentiment. She&rsquo;s so talented musically, but more importantly she cares about the development about the worlds next teachers. I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to be lumped into that over the last two years because I am a nerd, and it&rsquo;s so inspiring to see how she works. It&rsquo;s made me want to do the same.</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s a classy crew of teachers that I am so in love with right here at Gonzaga. I&rsquo;ve never seen so many people passionate about education and inspiring other people through music. When you see a movement, you just want to jump in and follow along. I just need to get in with this sea of incredible people who I love dearly. Not only do I want to be a director, I want to learn alongside <em>these</em> insanely awesome people. I&rsquo;m not going to get that crazy inclusive and loving community anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="whats-transpired-in-the-last-5-weeks">What&rsquo;s Transpired in the Last 5 Weeks</h2>
<p>I finished my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics with a focus in Statistics and minors in Data Science, Leadership Studies, and Music. I walked at commencement with the Class of 2024, all because at the time I thought that I was graduating. However, I did know at this time that I wanted to be a choir director.</p>
<p>The initial thought came to me the Friday before Spring Break. I happened to be in Dr. Stohlmann&rsquo;s office just because I wanted to pop by. I&rsquo;m going to be honest - I don&rsquo;t even remember why I was there. I&rsquo;m sure it was some choir nerding that I was wanting to do and Stohlmann was willing to listen to me. Dr. Sonbert from Eastern was also present. All I remember is Stohlmann walking to her office and me telling Dr. Sonbert that it would be cool to stick around and get a music education degree but Stohlmann wouldn&rsquo;t let that happen. Stohlmann immediately stopped dead in her tracks, turned around, and said that she would love to have me around to become a choir director. What then followed was another 45 minute conversation about how to go about transitioning into this field.</p>
<p>What we had finally settled on as a good path was for me to apply for a Masters in Teaching. Ultimately, we found out that per the laws of Washington state, it&rsquo;s possible to receive your teaching credentials and teach in a subject matter that you don&rsquo;t have a bachelors degree in. This would be the cheapest and easiest way for me to transition into the teaching space. There would still be plenty of music holes that I would need to fill in terms of coursework, but by staying here to complete the program in two years I could take those essential music ed classes alongside my masters to be fully prepared.</p>
<p>However, things got complicated when I went to apply for my masters. While it&rsquo;s true that I don&rsquo;t need a degree in the subject that I want to teach in, masters programs aren&rsquo;t designed for the path that I was wanting to take. The masters in teaching programs everywhere take someone who has content experience and give them the teacher skills to be in the classroom successfully. Since I don&rsquo;t have a music degree, there&rsquo;s no way to confidently say that I have the content mastery. There are programs that exist in Washington state that allow me to simply just get my teaching credentials, but these programs are only located in a few select cities and I would have to leave Spokane to make that happen.</p>
<p>If I wanted to do the masters route, there were two ways that I could prove the content mastery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Take all the courses that are listed as music pre-reqs. This option is hard and time consuming because it&rsquo;s essentially the entire music education degree.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Receive a bachelors degree in music. This could be music education, OR it could just be any flavor of a music degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know what Option 2 is saying - so long as I have ANY form of a music degree, I could get in for the masters in teaching. After talking with the music department at Gonzaga, we found that a BA in Music with a General Studies focus (i.e. just a plain music degree) would take me just 1 year to complete, especially since I have all my core complete from completing a previous bachelors degree in math.</p>
<p>With this information under my belt, I&rsquo;ve decided to <strong>stay an extra year at Gonzaga</strong> in order to receive my BA in Music. The number of credits that I would need each semester in order to complete the degree is VERY low (in fact, I barely make full time with just the coursework I need to graduate). As such, it gives me time to practice being a good choral director!</p>
<h2 id="where-i-can-go">Where I Can Go</h2>
<p>The benefit of choosing to do the BA in Music is that I have time to figure out what I <em>really</em> want to do with choral directing. The challenge with joining the masters immediately is that it locks me into public school teaching and doesn&rsquo;t give me the flexibility to explore other options. Now, I&rsquo;ve got another year to figure out what I want my career in choral music to look like. Right now, there&rsquo;s two options that I see as valuable to forwarding my career towards choral directing:</p>
<h4 id="continue-to-get-my-masters-in-teaching">Continue to Get My Masters in Teaching</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible that I still want to teach at the secondary level after this year. Since I would have an undergrad degree in music, I would be able to apply for the masters in teaching and have no issues with getting in from the content mastery side. This would equip me with the teaching tools that I would need in order to succeed as a teacher in the secondary classroom.</p>
<h4 id="pursue-a-masters-in-choral-conducting">Pursue a Masters in Choral Conducting</h4>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m so addicted to choir music, there&rsquo;s a real possibility that a masters in choral conducting would provide me with more exciting opportunities than just a masters in teaching. Originally, I thought that the best way to learn would be to stay here at Gonzaga - I get access to fantastic musical mentors and get to stay with the people I love so much and made me realize I want to do this for a living. However, a masters in choral conducting would give me more opportunities to hone in on my conducting and expose me to choral music outside of the pacific northwest which is all I know. I would also be surrounded by people who all are as passionate about choral music as I am.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Gonzaga is a <em>bad place for choral music.</em> Dr. Stohlmann is a fantastic professor - both from the perspective of a choral director and from the angle of training new teachers. There&rsquo;s also people here who want to be teachers - and will be FANTASTIC teachers. But at the end of the day, Gonzaga is primarily an undergrad experience. There are a lot of hoops that I&rsquo;m having to jump through in order to have the experiences I&rsquo;m having here because <em>no one has done this before at Gonzaga.</em> Leaving to be in a choral conducting masters gives me the chance to enter into a system that is already working, get new perspectives on conducting from other professionals, and surround myself with more people with the same mindset as myself. It would hurt to say goodbye - it always is - but if it means a stronger development for myself, then I want to take that opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-doing-this-year">What I&rsquo;m Doing This Year</h2>
<p>One thing is for certain - I will be here at Gonzaga for one more year. I may be here for more, I may go off and do my own thing. Either way, I&rsquo;m prepared to enjoy my time this year and make the most of what I have <strong>now</strong> before I make my next career development choice. I&rsquo;ll split this into three parts: my main educational endeavors, my side musical interests, and my personal musical growth.</p>
<h3 id="my-main-educational-endeavors">My Main Educational Endeavors</h3>
<p>My primary job here at Gonzaga this next year is to receive my <strong>BA in Music</strong> as well as a <strong>minor in conducting.</strong></p>
<p>In terms of the Music BA, this means completing major coursework towards the degree. I&rsquo;m super grateful to Dr. Hamlin, who is the music department chair at Gonzaga. He&rsquo;s been incredibly kind and helpful at crafting a path unique to my situation. As such, he&rsquo;s replaced all of the elective classes with music ed classes so that I can get some exposure to teaching methods - I&rsquo;m super grateful for this sacrifice.</p>
<p>This means that coursework I will take will consist of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing the Music Theory sequence (Theory III + Ear Training and Theory IV)</li>
<li>Taking the Conducting Sequence (Conducting I + II)</li>
<li>General Music Education Methods - this is awesome because I will also do the field experience that goes with it and have time to experience the classroom</li>
<li>Choral History and Pedagogy: This will consist of tons of individual reading and learning from Stohlmann the core pedagogical practices when it comes to teaching choir. This will be an independent study due to the accelerated nature of my path.</li>
<li>Piano Profficiency: It&rsquo;s important that choir teachers have some foundational piano skills. Originally I thought I wanted to take lessons, but after talking with Dr. Hamlin it sounds like I will get the same kind of practice by taking this class instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the conducting minor - this is where things get interesting! Part of the conducting minor goes with taking the conducting sequence, but there are a few additional things I have to do. First of all, I get to take conducting lessons each semester with Dr. Stohlmann where I will hone my skills and learn how to be a good conductor and educator. Those conducting lessons will come in two parts: part one is typical 1-on-1 conducting lessons once per week. Part two is then application in the classroom, where I will be expected to lead activities across the ensembles. Finally, I&rsquo;ll have to do a conducting recital. This would look similar to a conducting recital for a masters program - pick three concerts from the academic year and conduct on them! The logistics of how this will work is still TBD and will be finalized when school starts in the fall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most excited about getting to work with the choral program. While I&rsquo;m sure I will be thrown into having to teach small pockets in Glee Club and Concert Choir, I&rsquo;m excited to say that I will also have the opportunity to work with <strong>Musea</strong> this academic year, and I could not be more thrilled to have this opportunity. There&rsquo;s a soft spot in my heart for treble ensembles, and Musea has made strides this past year. The group is filled with so many talented individuals who are passionate about the success of Musea, and I can&rsquo;t wait to work alongside this incredible group - a highlight moment for sure!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also be involved in various music conferences and events throughout the year. I plan to continue being involved with the High School Choral Leadership Academy and High School Invitational that Gonzaga choirs hosts. I&rsquo;ll also be in attendance at some conferences this year, with Nafme over president&rsquo;s day weekend in Spokane being the major conference I&rsquo;ll be in attendance at this academic year.</p>
<h3 id="my-side-musical-endeavors">My Side Musical Endeavors</h3>
<p>When I originally found out that I was going to return for a music degree, I initially considered getting a degree in Sacred Music. Ultimately, I decided against it due to the large amount of additional work I would have to do for not as much of a return in sacred music coursework specifically. However, sacred music still holds a special place in my heart as it is the reason I fell in love with choir in the first place. As such, I also want to learn how to operate a choir in a sacred music space. There&rsquo;s two major ways I will get to develop those skills this year.</p>
<p>One is with my church choir job that I already hold. The choral director and pianist - Logan Shevalier and Christian Skok - are both absolutely phenomenal musicians, colleagues, and great friends. They&rsquo;ve been instrumental in my transition to this career, and I look up to both of them because they are great examples of people who are at the beginning phases of building their musical careers. While I will continue to sing for the choir as normal, there will also be opportunities for me to inquire about repertoire selection, planning of liturgical music, and potentially even having the chance to work with the church choir!</p>
<p>Additionally, I plan on continuing my involvement with student mass on Gonzaga&rsquo;s campus. It&rsquo;s a great way for me to serve and give back to my Gonzaga community through service. Daniel Danca, the point liturgical ministries person, is a pleasure to work with and is just as much of a sacred music nerd as me. As such, I&rsquo;ll also have the chance to independent study sacred music with Daniel as well, with the details of how that will work TBD. Daniel is currently working towards his doctorate in the field of sacred music, so there&rsquo;s plenty to learn from him about proper liturgical practices.</p>
<h3 id="personal-music-ambitions">Personal Music Ambitions</h3>
<p>When working in music, it&rsquo;s important to balance work music with music purely for enjoyment. As such, I have a few ways that I am carving time out for personal enjoyment with music.</p>
<p>The first is continuing to learn about composition. Dr. Kropf is an excellent mentor and is willing to continue having me in his composition studio which is incredibly nice of him. This is my way of enjoying music for myself, and I hope to continue building my compositional voice through working with Dr. Kropf.</p>
<p>Second, I plan on continuing my semi-pro endeavors with the Spokane Symphony Chorale. This year I&rsquo;m planning on doing 3 of the 6 engagements with them - the annual showings of Holiday Pops and Beethoven&rsquo;s 9th Symphony in December and the absolutely stunning and massive Haydn Creation in late April. I also hope to continue singing with the local barberhsop chorus for the next year.</p>
<p>Third, I want to participate for one semester in the Creative Music Lab Ensemble. I wrote a choral piece for them this past spring, and I really enjoyed watching the rest of their concert. There&rsquo;s an emphasis on music making in ways that one might not be comfortable or familiar with, and I want to have that experience for my own personal growth.</p>
<p>Finally, many of you know that I have had my fair share of ensembles I&rsquo;ve created over the years, and this year will be no exception. As I write more choral music, I would love to have people at least read through my pieces so that I can improve my writing - maybe even perform them if the opportunity arises. Additionally, I have a few thoughts for some bigger projects that may or may not speak into existence&hellip; more information to come in the fall &#x1f609;.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I don&rsquo;t want to set a regular schedule for when I will be posting content here, but I have a few ideas that I want to talk about as we progress through the year. I&rsquo;m also too lazy to set up comments for these posts (who even is reading these anyways?!) so if you have things you want to say to me, you know how to get ahold of me.</p>
<p>Hope everyone is having a great summer, and GU Choirs I can&rsquo;t wait to see you again this fall ;)</p>
