      <h1 class="f1 athelas mt3 mb1">Why Choral Singers Should Learn Music Theory</h1>
      
      
      

      
      
    </header>
    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Throughout my collegiate choral experience at a school filled with a choral program of mostly non-music majors, most people are very foreign to music theory. Some students were music minors and thus took one year of theory their freshman or sophomore year, but didn&rsquo;t get super excited about it (or even hated the class). Even the music majors who are in the choir aren&rsquo;t actively using music theory concepts while they are rehearsing, even if they are more comfortable with the subject.</p>
<p>I want to clarify - you technically do NOT need any knowledge of theory to get you through your collegiate choir experience. Unless you are a music major at a music college, chances are you can get through your college career solely on your ear or with a combination of a good ear and a basic sense of sight reading. At Gonzaga, most students in the choral program have the latter - i.e. some combination of a basic understanding of sight reading and a good ear to pick up on when they aren&rsquo;t fitting in with the rest of the choir. Some people are more in tune with their ears than they are with their sight reading. Others sight read first and then use their ears to spot check them. There&rsquo;s a wide variety of singers with their sight reading comfortability at Gonzaga, and we try to build that confidence up just enough so that every singer can at least sight reading as a tool to help learn music faster - and ultimately do less work outside of class &#x1f61c;.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the skillset that I&rsquo;ve developed in choir has been unique compared to the rest of my colleagues. I&rsquo;ve worked really hard to build myself as a good, well-rounded choral musician. As I&rsquo;ve done that, I&rsquo;ve found that there&rsquo;s been one thing that I&rsquo;ve done that has single handedly contributed to the reason as to why I&rsquo;m as good as I am as a choral artist - <em>I actually use music theory when I&rsquo;m learning music.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that I did <strong>not</strong> say that I can actually sight read well. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m definitely on the better end of sight readers in the choir. However, I can name a pretty large chunk of Concert Choir that can sight read either better than me or at my level. But when I think about the number of people who are thinking about their scales as they sing, identifying key changes, locating where their part fits into the context of the chord, suddenly the list starts to dwindle. I&rsquo;ve found that the skills I&rsquo;ve developed in music theory have helped me not only learn, but understand the musical meaning in a piece much faster than anyone else in the choir.</p>
<p>Having a good understanding of music theory allows you to be a more versatile singer that is capable of any job. You can&rsquo;t have a job as a section leader in a church choir if all you have is your ear. Most jobs hand you the music the morning of the service you are about to sing. You get potentially 1-2 run-throughs before the service to learn your music, and then you have to simply nail the music in the service. Hate to break it to you, but your ear alone is never going to save you there - the other singers in the church choir will be as clueless as you are and your ear is not going to be able to latch on to someone who is &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; singing your part. You have to be able to correctly sing your part without any help.</p>
<p>Luckily, adding music theory to your musical thought process is something that can be trained and practiced. After my freshman year of choir, I realized that if I wanted to succeed in my choral life beyond college, I was going to need to develop some musical skills. As such, I spent the next three years learning how to sight read alongside the basics of music theory so that I could use it in my rehearsal process - and I&rsquo;m still actively learning and practicing those skills. Eventually, I got to the point where my musical output was far greater than just being able to listen for my part. I&rsquo;m not like Dr. Stohlmann - I won&rsquo;t nail every note on a first read - but my consistency both with my notes and my understanding of how my part fits in with context is far greater than most other singers. It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to be able to audition into a semi-pro choir while I&rsquo;m still in college and be offered church jobs without having to apply and audition for them.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to share with you the <strong>5 music theory concepts that I consistently use when learning new music.</strong> Some of these will indeed be sight reading related, but some of them are general music theory concepts that go beyond just reading your notes on the page. If music theory sounds scary to you, I&rsquo;ll also have you know that <em>everything I&rsquo;ll talk about in this post does not go beyond a first-semester collegiate course in music theory.</em> This means that you can very easily learn and understand these concepts and practice them yourself in a short amount of time. If you are interested in leveling up your choral game to be able to take gigs that require a higher level of musicianship beyond that of the collegiate choral environment, then I promise you that these skills I&rsquo;m about to share will take your choral game to the next level.</p>
<p>So what are we waiting for? Let&rsquo;s get into the music theory topics!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: The order that I introduce the topics is intentional - the further down the list we go, the more that concept relies on mastery of the previous concepts. If you are trying to learn these the first time, I would advise that you work from #1 down to #5.</em></p>

<h2 id="0-learn-what-the-note-names-and-keys-are">#0: Learn What the Note Names And Keys Are</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming you already know how to tell what note is on a page. If not, then the quick refresher is to remember &ldquo;Every Good Boy Does Fine&rdquo; for the ledger lines in the treble clef and &ldquo;Good Boys Do Fine Always&rdquo; for the bass clef. The first letter of each word for each sentence tells you the letter on that ledger line counting from the bottom up.</p>
<p><img src="https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/images/blogs/04/0-ledger-lines.jpg"></p>
<p>Additionally, you should be able to read key signatures. There&rsquo;s a few simple rules that make memorizing key signatures really easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are sharps in the key signature then the key is a half-step up from the last sharp</li>
<li>If there are flats in the key signature, then the key is the second-to-last flat</li>
<li>If there are no flats or sharps in the key signature, then the key is C</li>
<li>If there is one flat in the key signature, then the key is F</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that these rules only work for MAJOR keys. To find the minor key, determine what the major key would be and move three half steps down.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a graphic of what all the key signatures look like if that&rsquo;s more your speed:</p>
<p><img src="https://TrevorBushnell.github.io/images/blogs/04/0-key-signatures.png"></p>
<p>Once you can identify notes on a staff and identify your key signature, you have all you need to understand the concepts in the rest of this post.</p>
<h2 id="05-to-address-the-hard-core-music-people">0.5: To Address The Hard Core Music People</h2>
<p>If you talk to anyone studying music that loves theory, chances are they&rsquo;ll rant to you about this mysterious <em>Circle of Fifths.</em> The Circle of Fifths takes every single note and arranges it into a circle, where each note on the circle is an interval of a fifth apart (don&rsquo;t worry, we will talk about intervals later in this post!). They&rsquo;ll die on a hill telling you it&rsquo;s the best thing ever in music and solves all of their musical problems and that everyone should know the circle of fifths. I have a friend who is so in love with it that they go around the school writing it on every whiteboard.</p>
<p>I too love the Circle of 5ths. I have plenty of thoughts about them and want to write a blog post at some point dedicated entirely to the Circle of 5ths and addressing the lack of education surrounding the WHY. But for now, the main thought that I have about the circle of fiths is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>YOU DON&rsquo;T NEED THE CIRCLE OF FIFTHS WHEN STARTING OUT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to cause so many people to be mad at me. While I think it&rsquo;s a great tool, the reality is when I&rsquo;m handed a new piece of music to interpret on the spot, <em>the circle of fifths is just not the <strong>first</strong> essential tool I use.</em> There&rsquo;s other musical ideas that are a) more basic and b) more practical that give far more leverage in the short term than the circle of fifths does.</p>
<p>And with that out of the way, I&rsquo;m done with the extra yapping. Onto the first topic!</p>
<h2 id="1-know-your-scales">#1: Know Your Scales</h2>
<p>Do you ever why you sing &ldquo;Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do&rdquo; as a warm-up in choir? Or why your director makes you use it while you are learning a song? The reason is because solfege outlines a pattern called a <em>scale.</em></p>
<p>A <strong>scale is a set of notes that divides up a specific distance between two notes.</strong> Most of the time this is generally between two of the same notes - i.e. choosing a set of notes between two C&rsquo;s or two A&rsquo;s for example. While there are some scales that don&rsquo;t completely cover the space between two of the same notes (like the pentatonic scale), most choral music uses scales that divide up two of the same note an octave apart.</p>
<p>One of the most popular scales is called the <strong>major scale.</strong> A major scale uses 7 of the 12 available notes and always follows a specific pattern - W W H W W W H, where W = a whole step and H = a half step. A major scale in C would be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. A major scale in Eb would be Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C, D, Eb.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker: if you are in a <strong>major key</strong>, you can figure out what notes are in the scale by ALWAYS FOLLOWING THAT PATTERN. This means that you can always figure out what Do-Re-Mi sounds like in every major key. Once you figure that out, the key is to start really locking into the notes Do and Sol. Do is what we call the <em>key center</em> - in other words it&rsquo;s the home note of the key. You should always be able to find the key center even if you get lost because it matches the key. Every time I get confused in my music, I always try to find Do because it re-centers my ear and helps me get back on the right pitches. The other important note is Sol. Sol is a nice midpoint and is the second strongest sounding note, right behind Do. My ear training professor told us that if you can find Do and Sol, you can find any note in the scale (and arguably any note as well - including those that AREN&rsquo;T present in the scale).</p>
<p>Start by singing a C major scale from Do going up to high Do. Then, practice skipping around the scale. Use the piano to check yourself. The goal is to be able to hear what the different skips between solfege syllables sound like so that when you encounter those jumps in your music, you already know what they sound like in your head. Once you can do it in the key of C, repeat the process for other keys. The more you practice this, the quicker you will be able to not only read what is on the page, but <em>hear in your brain</em> what that shift in notes sounds like.</p>
<p>Major scales aren&rsquo;t the only scales that come up in music. Another important scale to learn is the <em>minor scale.</em> The minor scale takes all the notes in the major scale, but lowers the notes on Mi, La, and Ti by a half step. In this case, the scale would then be &ldquo;Do-Re-Me-Fa-Sol-Le-Te-Do.&rdquo; Another way to think about the minor scale is to take your major scale, but start on &ldquo;La&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Do&rdquo;. Either way you choose to think about it, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are the same number of whole steps and half steps - they&rsquo;re just shifted (W H W W H W W).</p>
<p>BONUS: There&rsquo;s actually multiple minor modes, and you may encounter other ones when you are singing. &ldquo;La&rdquo; based minor is what we call the &ldquo;natural minor&rdquo; scale. However, the natural minor scale is missing &ldquo;Ti&rdquo; - which is INCREDIBLY powerful because &ldquo;Ti&rdquo; always wants to go to &ldquo;Do&rdquo;. As such, composers will simply change the &ldquo;Te&rdquo; in the natural minor scale to &ldquo;Ti&rdquo; by raising it a half step. This means that the new scale is &ldquo;Do-Re-Me-Fa-Sol-Le-Ti-Do&rdquo;, or &ldquo;La-Ti-Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Si-La&rdquo; in La-based minor. This scale is especially common in the common practice era with composers such as Bach. There&rsquo;s also another type of minor called the <em>melodic minor scale</em> that raises &ldquo;Le&rdquo; and &ldquo;Te&rdquo; up half steps to create &ldquo;La&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ti&rdquo;, meaning the new scales would be &ldquo;Do-Re-Me-Fa-Sol-La-Ti-Do&rdquo; or &ldquo;La-Ti-Do-Re-Mi-Fi-Si-La&rdquo; for La-based minor. This scale is sometimes used by composers to create more interesting melodies. Once you get used to major and natural minor scales, I would definitely take the time to get familiar with these scales because when you start finding notes that are consistently sharped all the time, chances are you may be sitting in a minor key using one of the different types of minor scales.</p>
<p>The only way to TRULY familiarize yourself with these different scales is to sing through them. This is why &ldquo;Do&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sol&rdquo; are so important - they are the same in each type of scale. As such, if you are super familiar with how to build your scales, you can find the note that you need by working your way up and down the scale. This is incredibly helpful for working with other people.</p>
